# Battleship-Game
This is a simple(only because there is no graphical user interface-GUI) Java version of the classic game Battleship.Battleship is usually a two-playergame, where each player has a fleet of ships and an ocean (hidden from the other player), and tries to be the first to sink the other player's fleet. We will be doing just a one-player vs. computer version, where the computer places the ships, and the human attempts to sink them.
